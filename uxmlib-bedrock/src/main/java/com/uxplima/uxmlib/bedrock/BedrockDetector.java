 * reference, so a server without Floodgate never touches the SDK. When Floodgate is installed the
 * {@link #forServer(Server)} factory returns the Floodgate-backed detector instead: that concrete class is the
 * only place the {@code org.geysermc.floodgate} SDK is named, and the factory constructs it strictly behind the
 * {@code isPluginEnabled("floodgate")} guard, so it (and the SDK it references) never loads on a Java-only
 * server.
 *
 * <p>Geyser without Floodgate is the second supported shape. Those servers still carry Bedrock players, and
 * Geyser can name them, so the factory falls through to a Geyser-backed detector when Floodgate is absent.
