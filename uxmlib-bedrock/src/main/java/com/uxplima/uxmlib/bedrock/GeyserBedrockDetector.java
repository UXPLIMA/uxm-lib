/**
 * The Geyser-backed {@link BedrockDetector}, for networks that run Geyser without Floodgate. Geyser alone still
 * knows which connections came from Bedrock, so those servers can have native forms too instead of falling back
 * to a chest menu for every Bedrock player.
 *
 * <p>Unlike its Floodgate sibling this is reached entirely by reflection: Floodgate is a {@code compileOnly}
 * dependency and can be named directly, Geyser is not one, so no {@code org.geysermc.geyser} type appears in
 * this file's signature and a server without Geyser loads none of its classes.
 *
 * <p>A lookup that fails answers "Java player", the same degrade the Floodgate detector makes: a menu open must
 * never fail because Bedrock detection hiccuped, and a chest menu is a working answer for a Bedrock player while
 * a thrown exception is not.
