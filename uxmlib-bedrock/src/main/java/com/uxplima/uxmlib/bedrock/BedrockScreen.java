/**
 * Sends a Bedrock (Floodgate) player a native Cumulus form in place of a chest menu. A caller builds a
 * SimpleForm from the entries it wants to show and hands it here; the SDK detail of turning that into a Cumulus
 * form and routing the tap back lives behind this interface, so a caller names neither Cumulus nor Floodgate.
 *
 * <p>The Java-only default is {@link #NONE}: it does nothing and carries no SDK reference, so a server without
 * Floodgate never touches Cumulus. When Floodgate is installed the {@link #forServer(Server)} factory returns the
 * Cumulus-backed screen instead: that concrete class is the only place the {@code org.geysermc} SDK is named, and
 * the factory constructs it strictly behind the {@code isPluginEnabled("floodgate")} guard, so it (and the SDK it
 * references) never loads on a Java-only server. A caller reaches this only after a
 * {@link BedrockDetector} has confirmed the viewer is a Bedrock player, so {@link #NONE} is never actually sent a
 * form.
